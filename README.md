# SmashStack_Homebrew_Setup
Save alternative for downloading Wii Homebrew so it's all in one location or you're worried about messing up your computer.

WARNING: This method requires a copy of Super Smash Brothers Brawl. If you do not have this game, you can't setup your system for Homebrew use using SmashStack. Consider looking into the Letterbomb method, which only requires the use of your Wii's MAC address.

ANOTHER WARNING: In order to load the files in Brawl, YOU MUST MAKE SURE TO DELETE ANY AND ALL CUSTOM STAGES. Nintendo automatically loads three sample stages on every copy, but make sure THESE ARE DELETED AS WELL, otherwise the files will not load and may cause other issues.

How to install SmashStack Homebrew:
1. Download or copy the files from this repository (i.e. PowerShell thorugh Git if you already have it installed; if not just download the files.)
2. Make sure your SD Card of AT LEAST 2GB and formatted to FAT format (and also must be a compatible format for use with the system: if you want to make sure here's a link to all compatible and incompatible SD card formats: https://wiibrew.org/wiki/SD/SDHC_Card_Compatibility_Tests).
3. Put the files onto the root of your SD card.
4. Take the SD card out of your computer and insert it into your Wii.
5. Load Super Smash Brothers Brawl and navigate to the custom stage option; open it up.
6. *INTIATE HACKING MODE* : Don't be scared by the Windows Error Bootup looking interface, just wait until you're prompted to press A. Once that's done loading, navigate to the 'Homebrew Channel' option and press A.
7. Select "Install the Homebrew Channel", and say yes when asked if you want to install the channel on the Wii Menu.
8. Finally, make sure you have BootMii installed as well; this is either as a boot2 for older consoles or an IOS for newer consoles.
9. If you were able to install BootMii as a boot2, then you're all set and good to go! If not, see step 10.
10. Open the Homebrew Channel from the Wii Menu or after you close BootMii installer and press the Home Button. The option "Launch BootMii" should be there, so select it and press A. It is recommended your backup your NAND memory if your console ever gets bricked, which you can recover with the use of Priloader.

After this, you are finally done! There are many homebrew applications you can set up for your Wii to truly make it your own, so do some research and look around to see what you can do. Hopefully this tutorial helped you. I know there's thousands of these online already but my thought was to have both a tutorial and all neccessary files all located in one easily accessible link.

(May update the read.me with reccommended software to use with Homebrew if I ever feel like making more repositories for Homebrew applications; that way it's easier to access for users.)
